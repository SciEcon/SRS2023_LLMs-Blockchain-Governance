- **Project Summary**: 
In recent years, the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has expanded across various domains, including finance, medicine, and law. LLMs have proven effective in tasks such as text generation and summarization, question answering, translation, topic analysis, and sentiment analysis. Unlike traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, LLMs leverage large parameters, extensive training data, and substantial computing power to perform these tasks with minimal or no specialized training.
However, the application of LLMs in blockchain governance remains largely unexplored. Through our literature review, we have identified the significant potential of LLMs in enhancing social governance within blockchain networks. LLMs can facilitate a more inclusive and diverse decision-making process by synthesizing and analyzing textual discussions within blockchain communities. Furthermore, LLMs can contribute to the transparency of blockchain governance by providing explanations and justifications for decisions made.
To bridge this gap, this article aims to introduce two key components. Firstly, we will present a dataset consisting of discussions from the Uniswap community on the Discord forum. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for training and evaluating LLMs in the context of blockchain governance. Secondly, we will demonstrate an application method utilizing h2oGPT, an open-source repository of LLMs, to apply these models to blockchain social governance.

  - Application Scenario (Data Source): Blockchain Governance (Uniswap Discord #governance channel)
  - Methodology: Large Language Models (H2O.ai)
